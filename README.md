#### Introduction to Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes theorem. It works with conditional probability that's why it is also called as probabilistic algorithm. Naive Bayes is simple, intuitive but yet powerful algorithm which gives acceptable results in many cases.

#### Conditional Probability
Conditional probability is defined as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome. Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event. 

For example:
* Event A is that an individual applying for college will be accepted. There is an 80% chance that this individual will be accepted to college.
* Event B is that this individual will be given dormitory housing. Dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% of all of the accepted students.
* P (Accepted and dormitory housing) = P (Dormitory Housing | Accepted) P (Accepted) = (0.60)*(0.80) = 0.48.
